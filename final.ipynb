    "## 1.1 Monte Carlo Tree Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Tree Search is a heuristic search algorithm for kinds of decision processes.It combines the generality of random simulation with the accuracy of tree search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid attention of MCTS is mainly due to the success of the computer Go program and its potential application to many difficult problems. Beyond the game itself, MCTS can theoretically be used in any field where {state state, action} is used to define and use simulation to predict output results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm process can be divided into four main steps: Selection, Expansion, Simulation and Backpropagation.The search tree would repeat the process many times and take the highest reward action as its decision. And in this project it can be described as the action with the highest winning probabiliby in each move.\n",
    "\n",
    "More detail would be introduced in the following contents.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Selection \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, my duty is to complete the Selection part of MCTS.\n",
    "This is the first thing we need to do to start the MCTS. In my opinion, it should be split into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very early time in MCTS, we have to select these unvisited nodes at first. Make sure every child nodes of the root node has been simulated and backpropagated once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, We need to choose the most worthwhile nodes for further expansion and simulation. We can determine the expansion value of the node through the “Upper Confidence Bound Apply to Tree (UCT)” algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$UCT(v_i)=\\frac{Q(v_i)}{N(v_i)}+c*\\sqrt{\\frac{ln(N(v))}{N(v_i)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation,$Q\\left(v_i\\right)$ is the Number of simulated winning results of node $v_i$ and $N\\left(v_i\\right)$ is the Number of node $v_i$’s simulations. $\\frac{{Q}\\left({v}_{i}\\right)}{{N}\\left({v}_{i}\\right)}$ , also called “exploitation component”, represents the traversal value of the node itself, which means expanding this node can better judge whether it is an appropriate decision or not; $\\sqrt{\\frac{{lnN}\\left({v}\\right)}{{N}\\left({v}_{i}\\right)}}$ is called “exploration component”, represents the tree's willingness to explore less frequently visited nodes. This part can be adjusted to a proper state by the coefficient ${c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection process is: Starting from the root node, find the node with the largest UCT among the child nodes. If this node is not a leaf node, repeat the above steps from the current node until the leaf node with the largest UCT is found. If this node is already in the game over state, return the current node; Otherwise, expand the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "After we get the node that needs to be expanded, we need to find all the child nodes that represent the next step or situation of the game according to the rules of the game and randomly select a child node that has not been simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the node has not been visited, we set it's $Q(v_i)=0$ and $N(v_i)=0$ and put it into the next step: simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we already choose a node to perform the simulation.Starting from the current node we choose, we let the computer take a sequence of moves and ends the simulation in the terminal node where we can confirm the game result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In generating the sequence of moves,we can choose the legal action in the current state randomly, but we can also use some method to choose action in each move.And the end of the simulation, the simulation result will be saved in the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "After simulating in the current node, we need to perform Backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we should propagate back the simulation result saved in the current node. Starting from the current node, it will find its parent node and update the statistics information of its parent node, which process will be repeated until the root node has been updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In details, the statistics information of a node can be abstracted as the total simulation reward $Q(v)$ and the total number of visits $N(v)$.\n",
    "### 1.1.5 Advantages of MCTS\n",
    "MCTS provides a better method than traditional tree search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aheuristic：MCTS does not require any strategy or specific practical knowledge about a given domain to make a reasonable decision. This algorithm can work effectively without any knowledge of game games other than the basic rules; this means that a simple MCTS implementation can be reused in many game games with only minor adjustments, so this also makes MCTS is a good method for general gaming games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymmetric：MCTS performs an asymmetric tree adaptation to the growth of search space topology. This algorithm will visit more interesting nodes more frequently and focus its search time on more relevant parts of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymmetric growth：This makes MCTS more suitable for game games with larger branching factors, such as 19X19 Go. Such a large combination space will cause problems for standard depth or width-based search methods, so the adaptability of MCTS shows that it can (eventually) find those more optimized actions and focus the search work on these parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time：The algorithm can terminate at any time and return the most current estimate. The currently constructed search tree can be discarded or reused later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concise：Algorithm implementation is very convenient\n"

    "## 1.2 Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning here is mainly composed of two parts, one is environment, the other is Policy (Figure1). The environment consists of three parts (state $x_k$, action $u_k$, and reward $g_k$). Informally, the environment is a function of black-box whose output is the current state and the reward of the previous action, and the input is the action. In this case, the position of the pieces on the current board is the state, and if we choose a move, the state of the board will change, and the good or bad move we choose before is our reward. A policy is a function that abstracts into an input state and outputs an action. Policy is similar to the thinking process of human beings. The chess player (Policy) makes an action by observing the state. Therefore, reinforcement learning can be understood as finding a function of the input state output action to maximize the reward of our environmental feedback. (The flow chart of the  algorithm is as below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://chiuchiu.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/img/20201220150247.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the size of the gobang board is 8 x 8, there are (8*8)! Possibilities. And win or lose only at the end of a game of chess can be judged, before this it is difficult for us to measure a move good or bad. This requires Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. In this part, we mainly introduce monte Carlo search combined with neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the neural network part, we used the alpha Zero training model. Since we did not have enough time for large-scale training, we combined the trained model with our Monte Carlo tree on the basis of understanding the model principle. And then we let them play each other. As a result, AI can be greatly improved in speed and accuracy, especially in 8*8 board. Then we explain our understanding and application of AlphaZero.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the difference in MCTS is mainly reflected in the different information stored in the tree structure, and the calculation formula of UCT is also slightly different. Finally, after MCTS search is completed, AlphaGo Zero also has its own strategy to select the real placement point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our training process, the model played a move each time, there will be two processes. One process is simulation, and one is play out. The simulation process can be understood as prediction before we actually walk, and the actual play out can be made according to our prediction results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1.simulation：\n",
    "Different from traditional Monte Carlo tree search, our simulation is guided by neural network output results. The MCTS we use here are are four steps (Figure2).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://chiuchiu.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/img/20201220150352.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, in the selection stage, we select the node under the guidance of the neural network and select the node with the maximum upper confidence bound value each time. Here UCB is a formula that balances confidence (or variance) and exploration values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "UCB &= Q(s,a) + U(s,a) \\\\\n",
    "U(s,a) &\\sim c \\times P(s,a) + \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_b N(s,b)}}{1+N(s,a)}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, both unexplored actions and actions that have been explored many times but have high exploration feedback will have a higher UCB value. $Q$ represents the value to be explored in the Monte Carlo tree, and the update of $Q$ is the average value of each backpropagation feedback value in the previous Monte Carlo tree search. While the $P$ value is the prior probability, which is the value calculated by the neural network, while $N$ is the exploration times of this action, and $c$ is a hyperparameter used to adjust the exploration of the equilibrium model. Therefore, the characteristic of this formula is that an action with a good reward for repeated exploration will have a high value, as well as an action without exploration. That is, why we have a well balance between exploration and optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, in the expand and evaluate stage, it starts with an empty search tree, expanding one node (state) at a time. When a new node is encountered, the rollout is not performed, but the new prediction node is retrieved from the neural network model to obtain the positions $s_L$ of each possible child node of the current leaf node, the drop probability $p_a$  and the corresponding value $v$（It is evaluated by neural rather than a random exploration）. For these possible new nodes, we create them in MCTS and initialize the information saved on its branch as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "N(S_L,a)=0 \\\\\n",
    "W(S_L,a)=0 \\\\\n",
    "Q(S_L,a)=0 \\\\\n",
    "P(S_L,a)=p_a \n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in stage of backpropagation, we need to do the backtracking and add the information of the new leaf node branch to the ancestor node branch. The back of the logic is very simple, from each leaf node 𝐿 in turn back to the root node, and update the data in the upper branch structure in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2. Play\n",
    "\n",
    "When the simulation process is over, we enter the sub-process. In this step, we use the ratio between the exploration times of different actions as our actual probability distribution, and we select our actions according to this probability distribution. The probability distribution here can be used when training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we applied MCTS search tree together with neural network to optimize neural network parameters through MCTS search tree, which in turn guides MCTS search through optimized neural network. One is the main and one is the auxiliary, which solves the chess problem with such a fully visible and well-informed state. Its algorithms allow machines to learn to do everything in a universal way like humans and to take into account the impact on the environment in a way that traditional machine learning can't."

    "- The design of the framework of our five-in-a-row games. Since this is a group project, it is important to break down the development of the games and algorithms into relative independent components.\n",
    "- Performance improvement, including code refactoring and the application of reinforcement learning.\n",

    "The most basic component is `GomokuGameState` , it store the information of our current game state, including\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.size`: size of the board\n",
    "- `self.board`: the board matrix of the game. Insteading of using a single `size*size` matrix to store the board, I use 2 `size*size` indicator(0-1) matrix for each players . This will simplify the checking of the win condition and is also a must in the training of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- `self._untried_action`: all untried actions under current state, \n",
    "- others: players, current player, last action ...\n",
    "\n",
    "it also includes some methods to take action, to check whether the current state is game over or not, to get current player and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is `GomokuGamePlayer`, I first use an abstract class to define that an object is a player if it could return an action given the current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class GomokuGamePlayer(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def get_action(self, state):\n",
    "        # return action\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we can define a `HumanPlayer`, a `MCTSPlayer` using pure MCTS and a `MCTSPlayerAlpha` using policy neural network, we can also define game players with other strategies. With the help of this two class, the game procudure could be simplified as\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while not self.state.is_game_over():\n",
    "    player = self.state.get_current_player()\n",
    "    action = player.get_action(self.state)\n",
    "    self.state.take_action(action)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then the other parts of the game were move to a `Gomoku` class to handle the graphical user interface of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms, there are three classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MonteCarloTreeSearch`: handling the tree search algorithm, we need to select a leaf node (`select_node`), we need to run the simulation on the leaf node (`simulation`) and we also need to find the best action after all simulation is done (`best_action`)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. All feasible actions of the node have been expanded, then we will use the UCT formula to calculate the UCT value of all child nodes of the node, and find the child node with the largest value to continue checking. Iterate down repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This node has feasible actions that have not been expanded, then we think that this node is the target node N of this iteration, and find the action A whose N has not been expanded, and continue to expand.\n",

    "3. This node game has ended, and it is directly backpropagated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of visits of each checked node will increase automatically at this stage.\n",

    "[3] Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for Nn to get an initial score. We start with $N_n$ and let the game proceed randomly until we get a game ending, which will be the initial score of Nn. Generally use victory/loss as a score, with only 1 or 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is to traverse from the leaf node (the node where the simulation starts) back to the root node. The simulation results are passed to the root node, and for each node on the back propagation path, specific statistics are calculated or updated. Backpropagation ensures that the statistics of each node will reflect the results of all simulations starting from its descendant nodes (because the simulation results are passed to the root node of the game tree).\n",

Therefore, the best child for the root node is always the child node with the most frequent visits, so we can choose the next action to be expressed as , Directly query the number of visited by all child nodes, and then find the maximum value. The function best_action() and take_action() performed this job.\n",
    " \n",
    "The Back propagate function is used to return the simulation information of the child node. When searching for a Monte Carlo tree, we will traverse the entire tree forward from the root node until we select (or expand) a suitable leaf node. Then rollout the selected leaf node, and you will get a simulation result. This result is used to update the statistics of the current node, that is, if the winner of simulation is the same as the prescription of the current node, the number of wins will be accumulated once, otherwise it will not be accumulated. And every simulation, regardless of the victory or defeat, the number of traversals will be added once. These two updated values ​​can be combined with the total number of traverses to obtain UCT, which is the basis for obtaining the best child node. After updating the current node, this value will start to trace the entire tree from the current node, and update the ancestor nodes of this node one by one according to the same rules until the root node is traced back.\n",

The search tree would repeat the process, in other words, do many iterations to get the statistics information of each possible move so as to find the best move.\n",
